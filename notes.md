Everyone has bad days. Whether its a frustrating conversation, a fight with your boss, or a terrible code review. It's easy for a good day at work to go bad.

With Joyzr, you can stop bad moods before they start. Inspired by cognitive behavioral therapy, Joyzr helps you break out of negative thought cycles by stopping them before they bring you down. Joyzr watches you as you are working, and whenever it sees a bad mood brewing, it jumps in with a cheerful message and a custom recommendation for a fun activity near you.

Joyzr is built on PubNub's real time serverless infrastructure, powered by Affectiva's emotion engine and tied together with XapiX's API consumption tool (using Giphy, Foursquare and Mapquest APIs).

Like the friend who always has your back, Joyzr keeps you happy.
